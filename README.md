# Adaptively Subsampled Krylov Subspace Methods
This repository contains the Julia code for the adaptively subsampled conjugate gradient and conjugate residual methods introduced in the paper "Optimal Krylov on Average" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03914).

The repository is based on [ConjugateGradients.jl](https://github.com/mcovalt/ConjugateGradients.jl).
